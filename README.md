This is my first personal project that use javafx and mysql-connector to connect to a simple mysql database;
i use a simple state machine design and a little bit of javafx-css to handle the system and the style of project;
as you can see this project is only a simple atm-machine with limited function ;
if you want to download it and connect to your database you can change a the mysql-password and mysql account inside a file call MySQL_Connector;
still improving with my programming skill the whole design for this atm-machine is really horrible :P ;
